# Referral Link Generator

      //Generated a unique-ID and binded with the link and also captured device serial number
    ToDo:
        1. On clicking a link execute a Device Serial Number function and capture the output and store it in firestore database
        2. Along with this store the UniqueId in DATABASE from the params passed in the URL
        3. Initially ReferrerID count should be 0 and after the Unique Serial Device User clicks on it it should be incremented 1 time per each click and update it
        4. If the new user clicks it should display Welcome User and the same device Serial Number clicks on it, should be displayed as Welcome back
